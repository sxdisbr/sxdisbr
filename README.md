# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello, world! I'm a tech enthusiast, musician, and lifelong learner with a knack for blending the logical with the creative. My journey through the realms of coding, music, and academia has been anything but ordinary. Let's dive into what makes me, well, me!

## 🎓 Academic Explorer
Armed with degrees in Sociology and Political Science, and a Master's in Communication and Education, I've always been fascinated by the stories and structures that shape our world. But why stop there? My quest for knowledge didn't pause at academia. Since 2011, I've been weaving narratives in mass media, telling stories that matter.

## 🎵 Musical Maestro
Before the codes and nodes, there were chords and notes. Bass guitar in hand, I was the frontman of Disbrainer, where I not only played the strings but also led the sing. Although the band's journey has ended, my passion for music plays on a loop.

## 🌍 Polyglot Programmer
Fluent in Spanish, English, and Russian, I find joy in expressing ideas in languages—both human and computer. My coding symphony began in late 2022, with Python as my first love for its versatility. I've since dabbled in PostgreSQL, JavaScript (just the basics!), C++ (also the basics!), HTML, CSS, and the rhythmic scripts of Bash, Zsh, and PowerShell.

## 🔍 Tech Toolkit
I wield Python like a maestro conducts an orchestra, with libraries like Pandas, Scikit Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and NLTK as my instruments. Each project is a new composition, a chance to harmonize data and algorithms into solutions.

## 💹 Future Financier
At the intersection of code and currency, you'll find me—dreaming up algorithms for algorithmic trading. Finance fascinates me; it's the rhythm I want to master next. Why coding, you ask? To unlock the secrets of markets and money, of course!

So, there you have it—a snippet of my saga. Whether it's dissecting data, composing melodies, or deciphering the dynamics of power and communication, I'm all in. Let's make the digital and the musical worlds collide, shall we?
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of technology and finance, particularly in algorithmic trading and financial analysis. I'm also keen on contributing to open-source tools that leverage Python for data science and machine learning. If you're working on making complex data more understandable and actionable, let's sync up!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with deepening my understanding of advanced machine learning techniques and their applications in predictive financial modeling. I'm also curious about best practices for deploying scalable ML models in production environments. If you're adept in these areas or have resources to share, I'd greatly appreciate your insights!
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Python and its powerful libraries like Pandas, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, and PyTorch. I'm also a musician at heart, so feel free to strike up a conversation about music theory, bass guitar, classical gitar, or the challenges of leading a band. And, if you're navigating the worlds of journalism or mass media, I'm here to share my decade-plus experience.
